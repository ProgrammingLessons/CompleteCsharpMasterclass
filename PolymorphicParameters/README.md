# Polymorphism
These are the methods that we can use for different operations specific to the classes we produce, 
of the methods in the classes that we create and add as inheritance to other classes.

In the example here, the car class is created. Audi and BMW classes were created by inheriting from the car class. 
The methods in the Car class are customized in other classes.
