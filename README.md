# What is this project?

In this repo, sample codes were written as a result of the examples followed in the training and the researches.

# Polymorphism
For the subject of polymorphism, an example car class and the classes derived from them have been created.

# Event Handler & Delegate
Classes that handle publisher and subscriber operations like message brokers have been created. There is an example of capturing this message from the subscriber class after the message is broadcast from the broadcaster class.
